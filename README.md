# Work Experience Week ReactJS Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Work Experience Week ReactJS Project! This project provides a foundation for students participating in the hackathon to create a small website or app addressing the challenges faced by school and college leavers in their job search journey.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the [ReactJS framework](https://react.dev/) to build an interactive and user-friendly website that helps young job seekers transition into the workforce. The website should address key challenges, such as discovering job opportunities, improving application materials, enhancing interview skills, and understanding financial planning and workplace rights.

## Problem Statement
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is committed to helping college leavers smoothly transition into the workforce.

Within teams, we would like you to design an innovative app or website to help people of your age group find jobs.  This will include:

* Highlight job vacancies that match their skills and interests
* Steps to create a CV tailored to specific job requirements
* Top tips on how to come across well during interviews
* Financial planning and budgeting

Your team's solution should aim to provide an engaging and user-friendly platform that is easily accessible and appeals to people a similar age to you, providing the information they need to navigate the job market effectively.   It should be engaging and interactive and demonstrate the use of modern app or website development techniques.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Project:**
   [Download Link](https://github.com/J4Numbers/wxw-starter-reactjs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. **Unzip the file**
    * Find the file
    * Right click -> Unzip File

3. **Edit index.html**
    * Go to [https://vscode.dev/](https://vscode.dev/)
    * Click 'Open Folder'
    * Find the project folder and open
    * Click `app/page.js` in the file tree
    * Edit the HTML

## Running the service

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
